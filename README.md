# hello-world
just another repository

Hi!
I installed sublime text 3, Git for windows, Node js, Browser sync ..... as instructions,
then follow another steps at github account like create branch, edit readme.md etc.
And ...
I learned how to
- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open and merge a pull request
